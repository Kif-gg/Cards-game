            <h2>Let us introduce you to our unique variant of the classical Spades game!</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Basics of the game</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The game is played by four players, no team play â€” each for their own.</li>
                    <li>Each player is dealt 13 cards at the start of every round, meaning the game is played with a
                        full set of 52 cards (excluding Jokers).</li>
                    <li>One game consists of 10 rounds, with the player who throws the first card rotating clockwise
                        each round.</li>
                    <li>The goal is to have the most hands by the end of the game and, optionally, to sabotage other
                        players (this second goal is optional and more fun with close friends)!</li>
                    <li>Card strength from lowest to highest is: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A. Any spade
                        (&spades;)
                        is stronger than any non-spade (&clubs;, &hearts;, &diams;).</li>
                    <li>After the cards are dealt at the start of each round, players must guess how many hands they
                        will win by the end of the round, ranging from 0 to 13. Incorrect guesses result in a penalty.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each hand equals 10 points. If you exceed your guess, the bonus for each extra hand is one
                        point.</li>
                    <li>First player to throw is determined randomly, then the order rotates clockwise each round.</li>
                    <li>Player who throws the strongest card takes the hand and automatically starts the next throw,
                        with the rest following clockwise.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Difficulties</h2>
            <p>Each difficulty adds more complex rules, pushing you to play more strategically (and dirty, if you wish)!
            </p>
            <article>
                <h3>Easy</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Standard gameplay, nills (0) are excluded.</li>
                    <li>The game assists you in throwing the correct cards; you must play a stronger card of the same
                        suit if you have one. If not, you must throw a spade to ruff.</li>
                    <li>Exceeding the guessing is with no limit.</li>
                    <li>If your hands are lesser than your guess, the initial guess is subtracted from the total score.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </article>

                <h3>Normal</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combines the rules of Easy mode with one extra:</li>
                    <li>Adding nill (0), if guessed correctly: +100 points to the total score. If you get even one hand,
                        penalty: -100 points from the total score.</li>
                </ol>
            </article>

                <h3>Hard</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Removes game assist of throwing the correct card.</li>
                    <li>Failing to play the correct card results in a penalty (your current guess is subtracted from
                        your total score, excluding extra hands).</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example 1: The player before you throws 4&clubs;. You have 8&clubs; but decide to throw
                            2&clubs;. The game will notify you of your mistake after you throw the card!</li>
                        <li>Example 2: The player before you throws 4&clubs;. You have any &clubs; but decide to throw
                            &spades;. The game will notify you of your mistake after you throw the card!</li>
                        <li>Example 2: The player before you throws 4&clubs;. You don't have any &clubs; but have
                            &spades;,
                            but decide to throw a different suit. The game will notify you of your mistake after you
                            throw the card!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Exceeding your guess by more than one results in penalty: subtracting the guess from your total
                        score.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example 1: Your guess is 4, you exceed and get 5; score is 41.</li>
                        <li>Example 2: Your guess is 4, you exceed and get 6 or more; score is -40.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>

                <h3>Are you mad?</h3>
                <p>WARNING: Play if you're sure that you know what you're doing!</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Adds more extreme rules, only for the best of strategists.</li>
                    <li>Blind nill (choosing 0 before seeing your cards) is added. If guessed correctly: +200 points. If
                        you get even one hand, the penalty is -200 points.</li>
                    <li>Player who chose blind nill can throw any card, not being obliged to go higher than the previous
                        one.</li>
                    <li>All players can choose if they want to ruff or not (when they're out of required suit) to mess
                        up
                        with other players (and mostly nills).</li>
